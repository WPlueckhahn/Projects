Projects I created


Welcome to my github portfolio! This repository contains different projects I created using publicly available datasets.
- The **Conjoint and Customer Base Analysis** investigates different movie genres and customer demographics that could be of interest for a streaming provider that wants to add new movies.
- The **BI - Text Analysis and Location Scouting** project uses yelp customer reviews to identify favorable locations for opening a new coffee shop branch. In addition, the reviews are used to identify topics that are particularly positively or negatively highlighted by customers of other coffee shops and provide potential guidelines for the young business.
- The **BI - Visualization** project examines data of a bike sharing provider in chacago that is interested in differences between member and casual riders. Time, geospatial, and other data is analyzed.
- The **Stock Picking S&P 500** project is more of a personal project. Here, I used the yahoo finance API to determine good stocks to invest in.
