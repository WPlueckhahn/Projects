# Projects


Welcome to my github portfolio! This repository contains different projects I created using publicly available datasets.
- The **Workforce Analysis - Performance and Well-Being** project examines predictors of employees performing outstandingly well and being happy with their jobs. It yields some very interesting findings about the promotion of job satisfaction in the company's workforce.
- The **Workforce Analysis - Churn** project examines reasons for employee churn by applying different machine learning algorithms and a factor analysis. Also, employees most likely to leave are identified.
- The **Customer Base and Conjoint Analysis** project investigates different movie genres and customer demographics that could be of interest for a streaming provider that wants to add new movies.
- The **BI - Text Analysis and Location Scouting** project uses yelp customer reviews to identify favorable locations for opening a new coffee shop branch. In addition, the reviews are used to identify topics that are particularly positively or negatively highlighted by customers of other coffee shops and provide potential guidelines for the young business.
- The **BI - Visualization** project examines data of a bike sharing provider in chacago that is interested in differences between member and casual riders. Time, geospatial, and other data is analyzed. The notebook file is too large to view on github. Please reach out for the full notebook or html document.
- The **Stock Picking S&P 500** project is more of a personal project. Here, I used the yahoo finance API to determine good stocks to invest in.
